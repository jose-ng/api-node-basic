# GraphQL

## Introduction

GraphQL is an open source server-side technology which was developed by Facebook to optimize RESTful API calls. It is an execution engine and a data query language. In this chapter, we discuss about the advantages of using GraphQL.

## Why GraphQL

RESTful APIs follow clear and well-structured resource-oriented approach. However, when the data gets more complex, the routes get longer. Sometimes it is not possible to fetch data with a single request. This is where GraphQL comes handy. GraphQL structures data in the form of a graph with its powerful query syntax for traversing, retrieving, and modifying data.

### Ask for what you want and get it

Send a GraphQL query to your API and get exactly what you need. GraphQL queries always return predictable results. Applications using GraphQL are fast and stable. Unlike Restful services, these applications can restrict data that should be fetched from the server.

The following example will help you understand this better:

Let us consider a business object Student with the attributes id, firstName, lastName and collegeName. Suppose a mobile application needs to fetch only the firstName and id. If we design a REST endpoint like /api/v1/students, it will end up fetching data for all the fields for a student object. This means, data is over fetched by the RESTful service. This problem can be solved by using GraphQL.

Consider the GraphQL query given below

```javascript
{
   students {
      id
      firstName
   }
}
```

This will return values only for the id and firstname fields. The query will not fetch values for other attributes of the student object. The response of the query illustrated above is as shown below

```javascript
{
   "data": {
      "students": [
         {
            "id": "S1001",
            "firstName": "Mohtashim"
         },
         {
            "id": "S1002",
            "firstName": "Kannan"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

### Get many resources in a single request

GraphQL queries help to smoothly retrieve associated business objects, while typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs. GraphQL APIs fetch all the data your application need in a single request. Applications using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.

Let us consider one more business object, College which has the attributes: name and location. The Student business object has an association relationship with the College object. If we were to use a REST API in order to fetch the details of students and their college, we will end up making two requests to the server like /api/v1/students and /api/v1/colleges. This will lead to under fetching of data with each request. So mobile applications are forced to make multiple calls to the server to get the desired data.

However, the mobile application can fetch details for both Student and College objects in a single request by using GraphQL.

The following is a GraphQL query to fetch data

```javascript
{
   students{
      id
      firstName
      lastName
      college{
         name
         location
      }
   }
}
```

The output of the above query contains exactly those fields we have requested for as shown below

```javascript
{
   "data": {
      "students": [
         {
            "id": "S1001",
            "firstName": "Mohtashim",
            "lastName": "Mohammad",
            "college": {
               "name": "CUSAT",
               "location": "Kerala"
            }
         },
         
         {
            "id": "S1002",
            "firstName": "Kannan",
            "lastName": "Sudhakaran",
            "college": {
               "name": "AMU",
               "location": "Uttar Pradesh"
            }
         },
         
         {
            "id": "S1003",
            "firstName": "Kiran",
            "lastName": "Panigrahi",
            "college": {
               "name": "AMU",
               "location": "Uttar Pradesh"
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

### Describe whatâ€™s possible with a type system

GraphQL is strongly typed and the queries are based on fields and their associated data types. If there is type mismatch in a GraphQL query, server applications return clear and helpful error messages. This helps in smooth debugging and easy detection of bugs by client applications. GraphQL also provides client side libraries that can help in reducing explicit data conversion and parsing.

An example of the Student and College data types is given below

```javascript
type Query {
   students:[Student]
}

type Student {
   id:ID!
   firstName:String
   lastName:String
   fullName:String
   college:College
}

type College {
   id:ID!
   name:String
   location:String
   rating:Float
   students:[Student]
}
```

### Type Definitions and Resolvers

In GraphQL, type definitions (`typeDefs`) and resolvers are fundamental concepts that work together to define and execute queries and mutations in a GraphQL API.

#### Type Definitions (typeDefs)

Type definitions define the structure of the GraphQL schema. They include types, queries, mutations, and their respective fields. Essentially, this is the "contract" specifying what operations are available and what data can be queried or modified.

```javascript
const typeDefs = gql`
  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    email: String
  }

  type Query {
    getUser(id: ID!): User
    listUsers: [User]
  }

  type Mutation {
    createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User
    updateUser(id: ID!, name: String, email: String): User
    deleteUser(id: ID!): Boolean
  }
`;
```

#### Resolvers

Resolvers are functions that provide the logic to obtain the data defined in the type definitions. When a query or mutation is executed, resolvers "resolve" the request by performing the necessary logic to return data or make changes.

```javascript
const users = [];

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getUser: (parent, args) => users.find(user => user.id === args.id),
    listUsers: () => users,
  },
  Mutation: {
    createUser: (parent, args) => {
      const newUser = {
        id: String(users.length + 1),
        name: args.name,
        email: args.email,
      };
      users.push(newUser);
      return newUser;
    },
    updateUser: (parent, args) => {
      const user = users.find(user => user.id === args.id);
      if (user) {
        user.name = args.name || user.name;
        user.email = args.email || user.email;
        return user;
      }
      return null;
    },
    deleteUser: (parent, args) => {
      const index = users.findIndex(user => user.id === args.id);
      if (index !== -1) {
        users.splice(index, 1);
        return true;
      }
      return false;
    },
  },
};
```

In this example:

- `typeDefs` define the `User` type, the queries `getUser` and `listUsers`, and the mutations `createUser`, `updateUser`, and `deleteUser`.
- `resolvers` provide the logic to handle these queries and mutations, interacting with an in-memory list of users.

### Queries

In GraphQL, all queries are made via POST requests to the exposed endpoint, and every request returns a 202 status.

### Type System

GraphQL includes a set of built-in scalar types ready to use:

- `Int`: A signed 32-bit integer.
- `Float`: A signed double-precision floating-point value.
- `String`: A UTF-8 character sequence.
- `Boolean`: `true` or `false`.
- `ID`: Represents a unique identifier, often used to fetch an object or as a key for a cache. It serializes in the same way as a string but indicates that it is not meant to be human-readable.

### Nullability and Lists

In GraphQL, you don't define a new type when you want to return a list of items from a field; you simply apply a list modifier to that type.

```graphql
type ObjectType {
  singleRestaurant: Restaurant
  multipleRestaurants: [Restaurant]
}
```

`Non-null` is also a modifier, and it can be applied to lists and other types in nested ways:

```graphql
type ObjectType {
  first: Restaurant
  second: [Restaurant]
  third: [Restaurant!]
  fourth: [Restaurant!]!
  fifth: [[Restaurant!]]!
}
```

### Object Types and Fields

GraphQL allows defining custom object types:

```javascript
type Book {
  title: String
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  name: String
  books: [Book]
}

# used to receive an object of data
input AddUserDto {
  email: String!
  password: UserPasswordType!
  rPassword: UserPasswordType!
}
```

### Apollo Server

Apollo Server is a standalone, spec-compliant GraphQL server. It works independently of any web framework and is designed to be as easy to set up as possible. Here are some key points:

- **Framework Agnostic**: Apollo Server can be used without relying on any specific web framework.
- **Simplicity**: It is often used for simple setups or for microservices where a minimal setup is beneficial.
- **Built-in GraphQL Playground**: Apollo Server includes a built-in playground for testing queries.
- **Latest Version**: @apollo/server is the latest and most modular version of Apollo Server.
- **Modularity**: It is designed to be more modular, allowing for easier and more flexible integration with various libraries and frameworks.
- **Separation of Responsibilities**: Instead of including everything in a single package, @apollo/server focuses on the core Apollo server and integrates with other specific packages for different needs, such as @apollo/server/express for Express.
- **Compatibility**: It offers better compatibility and maintenance, adhering to the latest practices and updates from the GraphQL community.

## A basic example

First install apollo server and graphql in our existing project

```bash
npm i graphql @apollo/server graphql-tag
```

Add `graphQL/index.js` and put this code

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer } = require('@apollo/server');
const { expressMiddleware } = require('@apollo/server/express4');
const gql = require('graphql-tag');

// Define GraphQL schema
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

// Define resolvers for the schema
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world!',
  },
};

// Create a new Apollo Server instance with the schema and resolvers
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

// Create an Express application
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Start the Apollo Server and apply its middleware to the Express application
server.start().then(() => {
  app.use(expressMiddleware(server));
  
  // Start the server and listen on port 4000
  app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql`);
  });
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Modules**:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const { ApolloServer } = require('@apollo/server');
   const { expressMiddleware } = require('@apollo/server/express4');
   const gql = require('graphql-tag');
   ```
   - `express`: This module is used to create a web server.
   - `ApolloServer`: This is the Apollo Server class for creating a GraphQL server.
   - `expressMiddleware`: This function connects Apollo Server to an Express application.
   - `gql`: This is a template literal tag for writing GraphQL queries.

2. **Defining the GraphQL Schema**:
   ```javascript
   const typeDefs = gql`
     type Query {
       hello: String
     }
   `;
   ```
   - Defines a simple GraphQL schema with one query, `hello`, which returns a `String`.

3. **Defining the Resolvers**:
   ```javascript
   const resolvers = {
     Query: {
       hello: () => 'Hello world!',
     },
   };
   ```
   - Provides the resolver function for the `hello` query, which returns the string `'Hello world!'`.

4. **Creating the Apollo Server**:
   ```javascript
   const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
   ```
   - Creates a new instance of Apollo Server using the schema (`typeDefs`) and the resolvers.

5. **Setting Up the Express Application**:
   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   app.use(express.json());
   ```
   - Creates an Express application and uses `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON requests.

6. **Starting the Apollo Server and Applying Middleware**:
   ```javascript
   server.start().then(() => {
     app.use(expressMiddleware(server));
     app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () => {
       console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql`);
     });
   });
   ```
   - Starts the Apollo Server.
   - Applies the Apollo Server middleware to the Express application.
   - Starts the Express server on port 4000 and logs a message indicating that the server is running.

This code sets up a simple GraphQL server using Apollo Server and Express, allowing clients to query the `hello` field at the `/graphql` endpoint, which responds with the string `'Hello world!'`.

Run it 

```bash
node graphQL/index.js
```
